## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using World Happiness Reports from 2015 until 2019, found in Kaggle to better understand:

1. What are the most correlated features to the happiness score?
2. What are the most happiest countries in the world?
3. Is there any change in the ranking from 2015 until 2019?
4. How are distributed the different features between regions ? 
5. Which conclusions can we deduce from regions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Here is the data used for analysis and a notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Steps of the analysis are described within the notebook.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](* MISSING *).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
